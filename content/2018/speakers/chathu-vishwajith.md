<p>The way we write APIs is changing. SPA frameworks like Angular are shifting the paradigm of API consumption and to be effective developers we have to keep up. We often dedicate a lot of time in crafting powerful APIs that interact with many different clients, but overlook proper security measures that can come back to haunt us.</p>
In this talk, we'll look at the proper way to secure our API's with JSON Web Tokens. We'll go from learning what JSON Web Tokens are, why they're the driving force in API security, and to put theory into practice actually build a real-world implementation using Node.js where we'll show common best practices.</p>
